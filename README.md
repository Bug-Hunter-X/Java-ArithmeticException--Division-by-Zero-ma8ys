# Java ArithmeticException: Division by Zero

This repository demonstrates a common Java error: an `ArithmeticException` caused by division by zero. The `MyClass.java` file contains the buggy code, while `MyClassSolution.java` provides a corrected version.  The error occurs because the program attempts to divide an integer by zero, an undefined mathematical operation.

This example highlights the importance of input validation and handling potential exceptions to ensure robust program behavior.
